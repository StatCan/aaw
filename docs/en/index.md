# Get Started with AAW

[![Set up Kubeflow](images/Kubeflow.PNG)](1-Experiments/Kubeflow/) Everything
starts with **[Kubeflow](1-Experiments/Kubeflow/)**! Start by setting it up.

[![Ask questions on Slack](images/Slack.PNG)](https://statcan-aaw.slack.com/)
You're going to have questions. Join our
**[Slack channel](https://statcan-aaw.slack.com/)** so we can get you answers!
<img src="images/SlackAAW.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the slack page. In the top right-hand corner is a link to create a new account" width="50%">

Click on the link, then choose "Create an account" in the upper right-hand
corner.

# Experiments

## Process data using `R`, `Python`, or `Julia`

[![R, Python, or Julia in Jupyter notebooks](images/Jupyter.PNG)](1-Experiments/Jupyter/)
Once you have Kubeflow set up, use
**[Jupyter Notebooks](1-Experiments/Jupyter/)** to create and share documents
that contain live code, equations, or visualizations.
![Jupyter Notebooks](images/jupyter_in_action.png)

## Process data using 'R' or 'Python'

[![R or Python in R Studio](images/RStudio.PNG)](1-Experiments/RStudio/)
**[R Studio](1-Experiments/RStudio/)** gives you an integrated development
environment for R and Python. Use the r-studio-cpu image to get an R Studio
environment.

## Run a virtual desktop

[![Virtual Desktop](images/VirtualDesktop.PNG)](1-Experiments/ML-Workspaces) You
can run a full Ubuntu desktop, with typical applications, right inside your
browser, using [**ML Workspaces**](1-Experiments/ML-Workspaces)

## Manage machine learning models and metadata

[![Machine Learning](images/MachineLearning.PNG)](1-Experiments/MLflow/)
**[ML Flow](1-Experiments/MLflow/)** lets you manage the machine learning
lifecycle. It's a model registry for storing machine learning models and
metrics.

# Publishing

## Build and publish an interactive dashboard

[![InteractiveDashboard](images/InteractiveDashboard.PNG)](/2-Publishing/R-Shiny/)
Use **[R-Shiny](/2-Publishing/R-Shiny/)** to build interactive web apps straight
from R. You can deploy your R-Shiny dashboard by submitting a pull request to
our [R-Dashboards GitHub repository](https://github.com/StatCan/R-dashboards).
![R Shiny Server](images/readme/shiny_ui.png)

**[Dash](/2-Publishing/Dash/)** is a data visualization tool that lets you build
an interactive GUI around your data analysis code.

## Explore your data

[![Explore your data](images/ExploreData.PNG)](/2-Publishing/Datasette/) Use
**[Datasette](/2-Publishing/Datasette/)** , an instant JSON API for your SQLite
databases. Run SQL queries in a more interactive way!

# Pipelines

## Build and schedule data/analysis pipelines

[![Build Piplines](images/BuildPipelines.PNG)](/3-Pipelines/Kubeflow-Pipelines/)
**[Kubeflow Pipelines](/3-Pipelines/Kubeflow-Pipelines/)** allows you to set up
pipelines. Each pipeline encapsulates analytical workflows, and can be shared,
reused, and scheduled.

[![Integrate with PaaS](images/IntegratePaaS.PNG)]()

## Integrate with Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings

We can integrate with many Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, like
Databricks or AzureML.

# Collaboration

There are many ways collaborate on the platform. Which is best for your
situation depends on what you're sharing and how many people you want to share
with. See the [Collaboration Overview](4-Collaboration/Overview.md) for details.

Content to be shared breaks roughly into **Data**, **Code**, or **Compute
Environments** (e.g.: sharing the same virtual machines) and who you want to
share it with (**No one**, **My Team**, or **Everyone**). This leads to the
following table of options

|             |           **Private**            |                  **Team**                  |  **StatCan**  |
| :---------: | :------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: | :-----------: |
|  **Code**   | GitLab/GitHub or personal folder |        GitLab/GitHub or team folder        | GitLab/GitHub |
|  **Data**   |    Personal folder or bucket     | Team folder or bucket, or shared namespace | Shared Bucket |
| **Compute** |        Personal namespace        |              Shared namespace              |      N/A      |

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
??? question "What is the difference between a bucket and a folder?"
    Buckets are like Network Storage. See the [Storage section](#storage) section for more discussion of the differences between these two ideas.

Sharing code, disks, and workspaces (e.g.: two people sharing the same virtual
machine) is described in more detail in the
[Collaboration](4-Collaboration/Overview.md) section. Sharing data through
buckets is described in more detail in the **[MinIO](./5-Storage/MinIO.md/)**
section.

# Storage

The platform provides several types of storage:

- Disk (also called Volumes on the Notebook Server creation screen)
- Bucket ("Blob" or S3 storage, provided through MinIO)
- Data Lakes (coming soon)

Depending on your use case, either disk or bucket may be most suitable:

|   Type |                                                       Simultaneous Users |                                                   Speed | Total size               | Sharable with Other Users |
| -----: | -----------------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
|   Disk |                                    One machine/notebook server at a time |                        Fastest (throughput and latency) | <=512GB total per drive  | No                        |
| Bucket | Simultaneous access from many machines/notebook servers at the same time | Fast-ish (Fast download, modest upload, modest latency) | Infinite (within reason) | [Yes]                     |

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
??? info "If you're unsure which to choose, don't sweat it"
    These are guidelines, not an exact science - pick what sounds best now and run with it.  The best choice for a complicated usage is non-obvious and often takes hands-on experience, so just trying something will help.  For most situations both options work well even if they're not perfect, and remember that data can always be copied later if you change your mind.

![Browse Datasets](images/readme/minio_ui.png)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! example "Browse some datasets"
    Browse some [datasets](https://datasets.covid.cloud.statcan.ca) here. These
    data sets are meant to store widely shared data. Either data that has been
    brought it, or data to be released out as a product. **As always, ensure
    that the data is not sensitive.**

## Disks

[![Disks](images/Disks.PNG)](Storage.md/) **[Disks](./5-Storage/Disks.md/)** are
added to your notebook server by adding Data Volumes.

## Buckets

[![MinIO](images/Buckets.PNG)](MinIO.md/) **[MinIO](./5-Storage/MinIO.md/)** is
a cloud-native scalable object store. We use it for buckets (blob or S3
storage).
