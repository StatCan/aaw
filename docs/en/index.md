**[Kubeflow](1-Experiments/Kubeflow/)** is a powerful and flexible open source platform that allows for dynamic leverage of cloud compute, with users having the ability to control compute, memory, and storage resources used. 

Kubeflow simplifies the following tasks:

- Creating customizable environments to work with data with user-controlled resource provisioning (custom CPU, GPU, RAM and storage).
- Managing notebook servers including Ubuntu Desktop (via noVNC), R Studio, JupyterLab with Python, R, Julia and SAS for Statistics Canada employees.
