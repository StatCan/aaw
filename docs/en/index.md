!!! info "What is the AAW?"
    Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) is an open source platform designed for data science and machine learning (ML) practitioners. Developed by data scientists for data scientists, AAW provides an unrestricted environment that enables advanced practitioners to get their work done with ease.

Built on the Kubeflow project, the AAW is a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing end-to-end ML workflows. It simplifies the deployment of ML workflows on Kubernetes, making it simple, portable, and scalable. With the AAW, you can customize notebook server deployments to suit your specific data science needs. We have a small number of expertly crafted Docker images made by our team of data science experts.

!!! info "What is Kubeflow?"
    The AAW is based on the Kubeflow project which is an open source comprehensive solution for deploying and managing end-to-end ML workflows. Kubeflow is designed to make deployments of ML workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.

Whether you're just getting started or already knee-deep in data analysis, the Advanced Analytics Workspace has everything you need to take your work to the next level. From powerful tools for data pipelines to cloud storage for your datasets, our platform has it all. Need to collaborate with colleagues or publish your results? No problem.
