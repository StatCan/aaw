    "# ReRun: Fast and Powerful Multimodal Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to ReRun, your go-to SDK for visualizing multimodal data that dynamically evolves over time. Engineers and researchers in fields like computer vision and robotics leverage ReRun to verify, debug, and demonstrate their projects with unparalleled efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multimodal Timeseries Data](./img/rerun-multi-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-Core Model:** ReRun operates on an open-core model, ensuring that everything in this repository remains open source and free. In the future, ReRun will introduce a commercial product that builds upon the robust foundation of the core free project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tailored for Individuals and Teams:** The open source project caters to the needs of individual developers, while the upcoming commercial product will specifically address the requirements of teams involved in building and running computer vision and robotics products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile and Cross-Platform:** ReRun is an SDK and engine designed for visualizing and interacting with multimodal data streams. It's simple to integrate and get started with, usable from Python, Rust, and C++, and built in Rust for cross-platform compatibility and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source:** ReRun is committed to open source principles, dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",

    "To unleash the power of ReRun, install it in your JupyterLab environment with a simple command:"

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "For an optimal ReRun experience, it's recommended to use a Linux, Mac, or Windows desktop session instead of JupyterLab. Access the full ReRun viewer by running `rr.spawn()` in the following script from your terminal emulator:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import rerun as rr\n",
    "\n",
    "rr.spawn()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if JupyterLab is your preferred environment, ReRun seamlessly operates within it. Refer [consult the official documentation](https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/notebook) for details on running ReRun within JupyterLab. The simplest JupyterLab example is to open ReRun using the `memory_recording()` and `show()` methods:"
