# Overview

## What does Kubeflow do?

Kubeflow runs your **workspaces**. You can have notebook servers (called Jupyter
Servers), and in them you can create analyses in R and Python with interactive
visuals. You can save and upload data, download it, and create shared workspaces
for your team.

**Let's get started!**

# Setup

## Log into Kubeflow

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
??? warning "Log into the Azure Portal using your Cloud Credentials"
    You have to login to the Azure Portal **using your StatCan cloud credentials**.
    `first.lastname@cloud.statcan.ca` or **StatCan credentials**
    `first.lastname@statcan.gc.ca`. You can do that using
    [the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    ![Azure Portal: Choose the `@cloud.statcan.ca` address](../images/azure-login.png)

- Log into [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.aaw.cloud.statcan.ca)

- Navigate to the Notebook Servers tab

![Kubeflow Manages the Jupyter Servers](../images/readme/kubeflow_ui.png)

- Then click **+ New Server**

## Server Name and Namespace

- You will get a template to create your notebook server. **Note:** the name of
  your server can consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. **No spaces, and no
  underscores.**

- You will need to specify a namespace. By default you will have a default
  namespace for your account, but for projects you may need to select the
  namespace created specifically for that project. Otherwise the notebook server
  you create may not have access rights to resources required for the project.

## Image

You will need to choose an image. There are JupyterLab, RStudio, and Ubuntu remote
desktop images available. Select the drop down menu to select additional options
within these (for instance, CPU, PyTorch, and TensorFlow images for JupyterLab).

Check the name of the images and choose one that matches what you want to do. Don't know
which one to choose? Check out your options [here](./Selecting-an-Image.md).

![Choose an Image](../images/select-image-screenshot.PNG)

## CPU and Memory

- At the time of writing (December 23, 2021) there are two types of computers in
  the cluster

  - **CPU:** `D16s v3` (16 CPU cores, 64 GiB memory; for user use 15 CPU cores
    and 48 GiB memory are available; 1 CPU core and 16 GiB memory reserved for
    system use).
  - **GPU:** `NC6s_v3` (6 CPU cores, 112 GiB memory, 1 GPU; for user use 96 GiB
    memory are available; 16 GiB memory reserved for system use). The available
    GPU is the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with specs
    [here](https://images.nvidia.com/content/technologies/volta/pdf/volta-v100-datasheet-update-us-1165301-r5.pdf).

  When creating a notebook server, the system will limit you to the maximum
  specifications above. For CPU notebook servers, you can specify the exact
  amount of CPU and memory that you require. This allows you to meet your
  compute needs while minimising cost. For a GPU notebook server, you will
  always get the full server (6 CPU cores, 96 GiB accessible memory, and 1 GPU).
  See below section on GPUs for information on how to select a GPU server.

  In the future there may be larger machines available, so you may have looser
  restrictions.

## GPUs

If you want a GPU server, select `1` as the number of GPUs and `NVIDIA` as the GPU
vendor (the create button will be greyed out until the GPU vendor is selected if
you have a GPU specified). Multi-GPU servers are not currently supported on the
AAW system.

![GPU Configuration](../images/kubeflow_gpu_selection.jpg)

As mentioned before, if you select a GPU server you will automatically get 6 CPU
cores and 112 GiB of memory.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "Use GPU machines responsibly"
    GPU machines are significantly more expensive than CPU machines,
    so use them responsibly.

## Workspace Volume

You will need a workspace volume, which is where the home folder will be mounted. There
are various configuration options available:

- You can either reuse an existing workspace volume from before, or create a new one.

- You can specify the size of the workspace volume, from 4 GiB to 32 GiB.

- You can choose the option to not use persistent storage for home, in which case the
  home folder will be deleted as soon as the notebook server is closed. Otherwise the
  home folder will remain and can be used again for a new notebook server in the future.

![Create a Workspace Volume](../images/workspace-volume.PNG)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Check for old volumes by looking at the Existing option"
    When you create your server you have the option of reusing an old volume
    or creating a new one. You probably want to reuse your old volume.

## Data Volumes

You can also create data volumes that can be used to store additional data. Multiple
data volumes can be created. Click the add volume button to create a new volume and specify 
its configuration. There are the following configuration parameters as for data volumes:

- **Type**: Create a new volume or use an existing volume.
- **Name**: Name of the volume.
- **Size in GiB**: From 4 GiB to 512 GiB.
- **Mount Point**: Path where the data volume can be accessed on the notebook server, by
  default `/home/jovyan/<volume name>`.

The garbage can icon on the right can be used to delete an existing or accidentally created
data volume.

![Create a Data Volume](../images/kubeflow_volumes.png)

## Configurations

There are currently three checkbox options available here:

- **Mount MinIO storage to ~/minio (experimental)**: This should make MinIO
  repositories accessible as subfolders / files of the `minio/` folder. This is
  still experimental and may not work properly currently.
- **Run a Protected B notebook**: Enable this if the server you create needs
  access to any Protected B resources. Protected B notebook servers run with many
  security restrictions and have access to separate MinIO instances specifically
  designed for Protected B data.
- **Allow access to Kubeflow Pipelines**: This will allow the notebook server to
  create and manage Kubeflow pipelines. Enable this if you want to use Kubeflow
  pipelines.

## Affinity / Tolerations

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "This section needs to be filled in."

## Miscellaneous Settings

The following can be customized here:

- **Enable Shared Memory**: This is required if you use PyTorch with multiple data
  loaders, which otherwise will generate an error. If using PyTorch make sure this
  is enabled, otherwise it does not matter unless you have another application
  that requires shared memory.

## And... Create!!!

- If you're satisfied with the settings, you can now create the server! It may
  take a few minutes to spin up depending on the resources you asked for. GPUs
  take longer.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! success "Your server is running"
    If all goes well, your server should be running!!! You will now have the
    option to connect, and [try out Jupyter!](/daaas/en/1-Experiments/Jupyter)

# Once you've got the basics ...

## Share your workspace

In Kubeflow every user has a **namespace** that contains their work (their
notebook servers, pipelines, disks, etc.). Your namespace belongs to you, but
can be shared if you want to collaborate with others. **For more details on
collaboration on the platform, see
[Collaboration](../4-Collaboration/Overview.md).**
