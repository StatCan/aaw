## Serverless with KNative

Kubernetes and [KNative](https://knative.dev/) let your services scale up and
down on demand. This lets you create APIs to serve Machine Learning models,
without the need to manage load balancing or scale-up. The platform can handle
all of your scaling for you, so that you can focus on the program logic.
