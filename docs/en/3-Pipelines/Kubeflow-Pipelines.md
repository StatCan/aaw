!!! warning "Kubeflow pipelines are in the process of being removed from AAW." 
    No new development should use Kubeflow pipelines. If you have questions
    about this removal, please speak with the AAW maintainers.

[Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/overview/) are in the process of being removed from AAW.

They will be replaced by [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/), which will be implemented on AAW soon.
