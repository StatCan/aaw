# Overview 

Argo Workflows is an [open source](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows)  cloud native worflow orchestration engine for kubernetes. It allows for parallel job scheduling and execution, and automation of workflows. 

Full documentation can be found [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/walk-through/). 

## Capabilities

- Workflow tasks can be defined as scripts (ex. python) or be containerized (ex. docker)
- Complex workflows can be modeled using Directed Acyclic graphs to capture dependency chains
- Independent tasks can be run in parallel with granularity to the level of implementation, reducing time intensive task loads
- Kubernetes platform agnositic, which means that your work is very portable
