!!! info
    Training machine learning models involves using algorithms to learn patterns and relationships in data. This process involves identifying features or variables that are relevant to the problem at hand and using these features to make predictions or classifications. 

## Why train with us?

_Training machine learning models on the Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) has several advantages._

1. **Open Source:** The AAW is an *open source data platform hosted by Statistics Canada* that provides secure (Protected B) access to a variety of data sources, including census data, surveys, and administrative records. This data can be used to train machine learning models and generate insights that can inform policy decisions and improve business processes.

2. **Versatile:** The AAW is *designed to handle large and complex datasets*. It provides access to a range of advanced analytics tools, in any language you like, including *Python, R, and SAS*, which can be used to preprocess data, train machine learning models, and generate visualizations. *Because the AAW leverages cloud technologies, *users can scale up their computing power as needed*.
*
3. **Secure:** The AAW is a *secure platform (Protected B) that adheres to the highest standards of data privacy and security*. Data can be stored and processed on the platform without risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## MLOps and Data Pipelines

!!! info "Optimize Data Workflows"
    MLOps and data pipelines are important tools used in the field of data science to manage and optimize data workflows.

### MLOps

MLOps refers to the set of practices and tools used to manage the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model. This includes everything from developing and training the model to deploying it in production and maintaining it over time. MLOps ensures that machine learning models are reliable, accurate, and scalable, and that they can be updated and improved as needed.

### Data Pipelines

Data pipelines are a series of steps that help move data from one system or application to another. This includes collecting, cleaning, transforming, and storing data, as well as retrieving it when needed. Data pipelines are important for ensuring that data is accurate, reliable, and accessible to those who need it. 

!!! info "Automation and Reliability"
    MLOps and data pipelines help organizations manage the complex process of working with large amounts of data and developing machine learning models. By automating these processes and ensuring that data is accurate and reliable, organizations can save time and resources while making better decisions based on data-driven insights.

### Why Containerized MLOps?

The advantages of using a containerized approach for training machine learning models with Argo Workflows include:

1. **Reproducibility:** Containerizing the machine learning model and its dependencies ensures that the environment remains consistent across different runs, making it easy to reproduce results.

2. **Scalability:** Argo Workflows can orchestrate parallel jobs and complex workflows, making it easy to scale up the training process as needed.

3. **Portability:** Containers can be run on any platform that supports containerization, making it easy to move the training process to different environments or cloud providers.

4. **Collaboration:** By pushing the container to a container registry, other users can easily download and use the container for their own purposes, making it easy to collaborate on machine learning projects.

Argo Workflows and containerization provide a powerful and flexible approach for training machine learning models. By leveraging these tools, data scientists and machine learning engineers can build, deploy, and manage machine learning workflows with ease and reproducibility.

## How to Train Models

There are multiple ways to train machine learning models and it is not our place to tell anyone how to do it. That being said we have provided below a couple of guides on how to train machine learning models using the tools available on the AAW. The first tutorial is about training a simple model directly in a JupyterLab notebook. The second tutorial assumes the user is more advanced and is interested in defining an MLOps pipeline for training models using Argo Workflows.

### Create a Notebook Server on the AAW

!!! info "Notebook Servers"
    Regardless of whether you plan on working in JupyterLab, R Studio or something more advanced with Argo Workflows, you'll need the appropriate notebook server. [Follow the instructions found here to get started.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12yTDlbMCmbg0ccdea2h0vwhs5YTa_GHm_3DieG5A-k8/edit?usp=sharing) 

### Using JupyterLab

![JupyterLab](../images/jupyterlab.jpg)

!!! info "JupyterLab is Popular"
    Training machine learning models with JupyterLab is a popular approach among data scientists and machine learning engineers.

Here you will find the steps required to train a machine learning model with JupyterLab on the AAW. Because we are a multi-lingual environment, we've done our best to provide code examples in our most popular languages, `Python`, `R` and `SAS`.

#### 1. Import the required libraries

Once you have a JupyterLab session running, you need to import the required libraries for your machine learning model. This could include libraries such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Tensorflow`, or `PyTorch`. If you are using `R`, you'll want `tidyverse`, `caret` and `janitor`.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="libraries.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # tensorflow and keras for building and training deep learning models  
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras

    # numpy for numerical computations  
    import numpy as np

    # pandas for data manipulation and analysis  
    import pandas as pd

    # matplotlib for data visualization  
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="libraries.R" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript

    # tidyverse for awesome data analysis and munging tools
    library(tidyverse)

    # janitor to clean your data
    library(janitor)

    # caret for easy machine learning
    library(caret)
    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py  title="libraries.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # the only library you'll need to access SAS from Python
    import saspy
    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="libraries.sas" linenums="1"

    ```

!!! note "About the Code"
    The code examples you see in this document and throughout the documentation are for illustrative purposes to get you started on your projects. Depending on the specific task or project, other libraries and steps may be required.

#### 2. Load and preprocess the data

Next, you need to load and preprocess the data you'll be using to train your machine learning model. This could include data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization. The exact preprocessing steps you'll need to perform will depend on the specific dataset you're working with, the requirements of your machine learning model and the job to be done.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="load_data.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary packages
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Data cleaning! A lot more can be done, this is basic
    data = data.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
    data = data.drop_duplicates()  # Drop duplicate rows

    # Feature extraction
    X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]  # Select relevant features

    # Normalization
    scaler = StandardScaler()  # Create a scaler object
    X_norm = scaler.fit_transform(X)  # Normalize the feature values
    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="load_data.R" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript

    # Import necessary packages
    library(tidyverse)
    library(janitor)
    
    # Load data from a CSV file
    data <- read_csv("data.csv")

    # Clean data using janitor
    data_cleaned <- data %>%
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace in column names
    clean_names() %>%
    # Remove rows with missing values
    remove_empty() %>%
    # Convert date column to Date format
    mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
    # Remove duplicate rows
    distinct() %>%
    # Reorder columns
    select(date, column2, column1, column3)
    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py title="load_data.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary packages
    import saspy

    # Start a SAS session and check configuration information
    sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='default')

    # Load data from a CSV file
    data = sas.read_csv("./data.csv")
    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="load_data.sas" linenums="1"
    /* Reading a comma delimited file with a .csv extension                       */
    /*                                                                            */
    /* Since the DBMS= value is CSV, you do not have to use the DELIMITER=        */
    /* statement.  By default, it is assumed the variable names are on the first  */
    /* row, so the GETNAMES= statement is not required.                           */
    /*                                                                            */
    /* Create comma delimited test file to read using PROC IMPORT below.          */

    /* Load data from a CSV file */
    proc import
        datafile='data.csv'
        out=data
        dbms=csv
        replace; 
    run;

    /* Display data */
    proc print;
    run;
    ```

#### 3. Split the data into training and testing sets

 Once the data is preprocessed, you need to split it into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="train_test.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary packages
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_norm,
    data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="train_test.R" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript

    # Import necessary packages
    library(caret)

    # Load the dataset
    data <- read.csv("my-dataset.csv")

    # Set the seed for reproducibility
    set.seed(123)

    # Split the dataset into train and test using caret's createDataPartition function
    train_index <- createDataPartition(data$target_variable, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
    train_data <- data[train_index, ]
    test_data <- data[-train_index, ]
    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py title="train_test.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="train_test.sas" linenums="1"

    ```

!!! note
    We split the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `scikit-learn`, which randomly splits the data into two sets based on the specified test size and random seed.

#### 4. Define and train the machine learning model

With the data split, you can now define and train your machine learning model using the training set. This could involve selecting the appropriate algorithm, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="train.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary packages
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv("my-dataset.csv")

    # Split the dataset into train and test
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.iloc[:, :-1], data.iloc[:, -1], test_size=0.3, random_state=123)

    # Train the model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=123)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Print the accuracy score on the test data
    print("Accuracy on test set: {:.3f}".format(model.score(X_test, y_test)))
    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="train.R" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript

    # Import necessary packages
    library(caret)

    # Load the dataset
    data <- read.csv("my-dataset.csv")

    # Set the seed for reproducibility
    set.seed(123)

    # Split the dataset into train and test using caret's createDataPartition function
    train_index <- createDataPartition(data$target_variable, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
    train_data <- data[train_index, ]
    test_data <- data[-train_index, ]

    # Define the training control
    train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

    # Train the model using caret's train function, (method = "rf" is for random forest)
    model <- train(target_variable ~ ., data = train_data, method = "rf", trControl = train_control)

    # Print the model object to view the results
    print(model)
    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py title="train.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary packages
    import saspy
    import pandas as pd

    # Establish a connection to a SAS session
    sas = saspy.SASsession()

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv("my-dataset.csv")

    # Upload the dataset to SAS
    sas_df = sas.df2sd(data, "mydata")

    # Split the dataset into train and test
    train, test = sas.surveyselect(data=sas_df,
                                method="SRS",
                                seed=123,
                                samprate=0.7,
                                outall=True,
                                strata="target_variable",
                                partind=True)

    # Train the model using the HPFOREST procedure
    model = sas.hpforest(data=train,
                        target="target_variable",
                        input="input_variable_1-input_variable_n",
                        partition="rolevar",
                        rolevars={"test": "0", "train": "1"},
                        nominals=["input_variable_1-input_variable_n"],
                        forestopts={"ntree": 100, "seed": 123})

    # Score the model on the test data
    predictions = model.predict(newdata=test, out=pred_out)

    # Compute the accuracy score on the test data
    accuracy = sas.freq(data=predictions, tables="target_variable*p_target_variable", nocum=True, nocol=True)

    # Print the accuracy score
    print("Accuracy on test set: {:.3f}".format(accuracy.Frequency.iloc[0, 1] / accuracy.Frequency.iloc[:, 1].sum()))

    # Disconnect from the SAS session
    sas.disconnect()
    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="train.sas" linenums="1"
    /* Load the dataset */
    proc import datafile="my-dataset.csv" out=mydata dbms=csv replace;
    run;

    /* Split the dataset into train and test */
    proc surveyselect data=mydata method=srs seed=123 out=selected outall
    samprate=0.7;
    strata target_variable;
    run;

    /* Train the model */
    proc hpforest data=selected;
    class _all_;
    target target_variable / level=nominal;
    partition rolevar=target_variable(test="0" train="1");
    input _all_;
    forest ntree=100 seed=123;
    run;

    /* Score the model on the test data */
    proc hpforest predict testdata=selected out=testout;
    run;

    /* Print the accuracy score on the test data */
    proc freq data=testout;
    tables target_variable*p_target_variable / nocum nocol;
    run;
    ```

#### 5. Evaluate the model

After training the model, you need to evaluate its performance on the testing set. This will give you an idea of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="evaluate.py" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="evaluate.R" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py title="evaluate.py" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="evaluate.sas" linenums="1"

    ```

#### 6. Deploy the model

Finally, you can deploy the trained machine learning model in a production environment.

=== "Python"
    ``` py title="deploy.py" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "R"
    ``` r title="deploy.R" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "SASPy"
    ``` py title="deploy.py" linenums="1"

    ```
=== "SAS"
    ``` sas title="deploy.sas" linenums="1"

    ```

### Using Argo Workflows

![Argo Workflows](../images/argo-workflows-assembly-line.jpg)

!!! info "MLOps Best Practices"
    Argo Workflows is an excellent tool for anyone looking to implement MLOps practices and streamline the process of training and deploying machine learning models or other data science tasks such as ETL.

**[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/)**  is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition). It is particularly well-suited for use in machine learning and data science workflows.

Argo Workflows allows you to

- Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
- Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
- Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

making it easy to manage the entire end-to-end machine learning pipeline. With Argo Workflows, you can easily build workflows that incorporate tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment, all within a Kubernetes environment.

    <h3>Argo Workflows</h3>
    </center>

Below are the steps to train a machine learning model using Argo Workflows on the AAW.

#### 1. Write a script to train your model

Here's an example script that trains a logistic regression model on the iris dataset. Don't forget to view the code from each language below.

=== "Python"

    ``` python title="train.py" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # Import necessary libraries
    import argparse
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    import joblib

    # Parse input arguments
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Train logistic regression model on iris dataset.")
    parser.add_argument("--input", default="iris.csv", help="Path to input dataset file.")
    parser.add_argument("--output", default="model.pkl", help="Path to output model file.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Load iris dataset
    data = load_iris()
    X, y = data.data, data.target

    # Split data into train and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train logistic regression model
    clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate model on test set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

    # Save model to file
    joblib.dump(clf, args.output)
    ```

=== "R"

    ``` r title="train.R" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript

    # Import necessary libraries
    library(caret)

    # Parse input arguments
    args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
    input_file <- ifelse(length(args) > 0, args[1], "iris.csv")
    output_file <- ifelse(length(args) > 1, args[2], "model.rds")

    # Load iris dataset
    data(iris)
    X <- iris[, 1:4]
    y <- iris[, 5]

    # Split data into train and test sets
    set.seed(42)
    train_index <- createDataPartition(y, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
    X_train <- X[train_index, ]
    y_train <- y[train_index]
    X_test <- X[-train_index, ]
    y_test <- y[-train_index]

    # Train logistic regression model
    clf <- train(x = X_train, y = y_train, method = "glm")

    # Evaluate model on test set
    y_pred <- predict(clf, newdata = X_test)
    accuracy <- confusionMatrix(y_pred, y_test)$overall["Accuracy"]
    print(paste0("Accuracy: ", accuracy))

    # Save model to file
    saveRDS(clf, output_file)
    ```
#### 2. Write a Dockerfile to run your code

You'll need a Dockerfile that includes all necessary dependencies for training your machine learning model. This could include

- packages like
  - `scikit-learn`, `pandas` or `numpy` if you are using `Python`
  - `caret`, `janitor` and `tidyverse` if you are using `R` 
- your own custom libraries or scripts
- your machine learning model code in the form of a script [as in the above example](#1-write-a-script-to-train-your-model).

Use the following `Dockerfile` as a starting point for your `R` and `Python` projects.

=== "Python"

    ``` docker title="Dockerfile" linenums="1"
    FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

    # Install any necessary dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir scikit-learn pandas numpy

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy code into container
    COPY train.py .

    # Set entrypoint
    ENTRYPOINT ["python", "train.py"]
    ```

=== "R"
    ``` docker title="Dockerfile" linenums="1"
    FROM rocker/r-base:latest

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        libssl-dev \
        libcurl4-openssl-dev \
        libxml2-dev \
        && apt-get clean \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    RUN R -e 'install.packages(c("caret", "janitor", "tidyverse"))'

    COPY train.R /app/train.R

    WORKDIR /app

    ENTRYPOINT ["Rscript", "train.R"]
    ```

#### 3. Write your workflow in YAML

YAML is Yet Another Markup Language and you'll need to write down the steps of your training pipeline in an Argo Workflows YAML file. This file should include reference to the Dockerfile you created in [Step 1](#2-write-a-dockerfile-to-run-your-code), as well as any input data and output data you'll be working with.

Here is an example YAML file for a simple machine learning pipeline that trains a logistic regression model on the iris dataset. The only real difference between the `Python` and `R` versions is the command `command: ["python", "train.py"]` vs `command: ["Rscript", "train.R"]` and the models are stored in different formats, `pkl` for `python` and `rds` for `R`.

The YAML file defines a single step called `train` that runs  script called `train.py` or `train.R` in the Docker image `machine-learning:v1`. The script takes an input dataset file, specified by a parameter called `dataset`, and outputs a trained model file to an output artifact called `model.pkl` or `model.rds` depending on the language used.

=== "Python"
    ``` yaml title="workflow.yaml" linenums="1"
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Workflow
    metadata:
    generateName: ml-pipeline-
    spec:

    templates:
    - name: train
        container:
        image: machine-learning:v1
        command: ["python", "train.py"]
        args: ["--input", "{{inputs.parameters.dataset}}", "--output", "{{outputs.artifacts.model}}"]
        inputs:
        parameters:
        - name: dataset
            default: "iris.csv"
        outputs:

            path: /output/model.pkl
    ```

        - name: model
            path: /output/model.rds
    ```

#### 4. Submit the workflow using the Argo Workflows CLI

To run the above workflow, you will first need to push the Dockerfile to our container registry and , and then submit the YAML file using the `argo submit` command. Once the pipeline has completed, you can retrieve the trained model file by downloading the output artifact from the `argo logs` command.

``` bash title="Terminal Emulator"
$ argo submit workflow.yaml       # submit a workflow spec to Kubernetes
```

#### 5. Monitor the pipeline using the Argo Workflows CLI

As the pipeline runs, you can monitor its progress using the Argo Workflows CLI. This will show you which steps have completed successfully and which are still running. Below are some useful commands, for more information about the Argo Workflows CLI, please check out [the official Argo Workflows CLI documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/walk-through/argo-cli/).

``` bash title="Terminal Emulator"
$ argo list                       # list current workflows
$ argo get workflow-xxx           # get info about a specific workflow
$ argo logs workflow-xxx          # print the logs from a workflow
$ argo delete workflow-xxx        # delete workflow

```

#### 6. Retrieve the trained model

Once the pipeline has completed, you can retrieve the output data using the argo logs command or by viewing the output artifacts using the CLI, i.e. navigate to the directory you specified in your script and locate the file `model.pkl` or `model.rds`. The following code snippet, taken from [the above training script](#1-define-the-machine-learning-model-and-its-dependencies), tells the respective programming language where to save the trained model.

=== "Python"

    ``` python title="Saving Output Data" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    #
    parser.add_argument("--output", default="model.pkl", help="Path to output model file.")
    #
    # Save model to file
    joblib.dump(clf, args.output)
    ```

=== "R"

    ``` r title="Saving Output Data" linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
    #
    output_file <- ifelse(length(args) > 1, args[2], "model.rds")
    #
    # Save model to file
    saveRDS(clf, output_file)
    ```

### Examples using Argo Workflows-based SDKs

If you prefer to use a higher level framework, then we have `Couler` and `Hera`. These frameworks make the creation and management of complex workflows more accessible to a wider audience.

#### Hera

Hera aims to simplify the process of building and submitting workflows by abstracting away many of the technical details through a simple application programming interface. It also uses a consistent set of terminology and concepts that align with Argo Workflows, making it easier for users to learn and use both tools together.

#### Couler

Couler provides a simple, unified application programming interface for defining workflows using an imperative programming style. It also automatically constructs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for the workflows, which can help to simplify the process of creating and managing them.
