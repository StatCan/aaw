# Custom Web Apps

We can deploy anything as long as it's open source and we can put it in a Docker
container. For instance, Node.js apps, Flask or Dash apps. Etc.

    We just push these kinds of applications through GitHub into the server. The
    source for the above app is
    [`StatCan/covid19`](https://github.com/StatCan/covid19)

# How to get your app hosted

If you already have a web app in a git repository then, as soon as it's
containerized, we can fork the Git repository into the StatCan GitHub repository
and point a URL to it. To update it, you'll just interact with the StatCan
GitHub repository with Pull Requests.
