# Custom Webapps

We can deploy anything as long as it's open source and we can put it in a Docker
container. For instance, NodeJS apps, Flask or Dash apps. Etc.

    We just push these kinds of applications through Github into the server. The
    source for the above app is
    [github.com/StatCan/covid19](https://github.com/StatCan/covid19)

# How to get your app hosted

If you already have a webapp in a git repository, then as soon as it's
Dockerized, we can fork the Git repository into the StatCan github repository
and point a url to it. To update it, you'll just interact with the Statcan
Github repository with Pull Requests.
