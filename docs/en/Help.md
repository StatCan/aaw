# Have questions? Or feedback?

Come join us on the
[Advanced Analytics Workspace Slack channel](https://statcan-aaw.slack.com)! You
will find a bunch of other users of the platform there who may be able to answer
your questions, and some of the engineers will usually be present on the
channel. You can ask questions and provide feedback there.
