## __IMPORTANT NOTES__
1. Please do NOT store your token _anywhere_ in your workspace server file system. Contributors to a namespace will have access to them.
2. If there is a contributor external to Statistics Canada in your namespace, you will lose access to cloud main Gitlab access!

-------------------


Thankfully, using the cloud main Gitlab on the AAW is just like how you would regularly use git. 

### Step 1: Locate the Git repo you want to clone and copy the clone with HTTPS option
If your repository is private, you will need to also do Step 4 (Creating a Personal Access Token) for this to go through. 
For me this was a test repo

### Step 2: Paste the copied link into one of your workspace servers

### Step 3: Success! 
As seen in the above screenshot I have cloned the repo!

### Step 4: Create a Personal Access Token for pushing (also used if pulling from a private repository)
If you try to `git push ....` you will encounter an error eventually leading you to the [Gitlab help documentation](https://gitlab.k8s.cloud.statcan.ca/help/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.md#error-http-basic-access-denied-the-provided-password-or-token-)

You will need to make a Personal Access Token for this. To achieve this go in Gitlab, click your profile icon and then hit `Preferences` and then `Access Tokens`

Follow the prompts entering the name, the token expiration date and granting the token permissions (I granted `write_repository`)

### Step 5: Personalize `Git` to be you
Run `git config user.email ....` and `git config user.name ...` to match your Gitlab identity.

### Step 6: Supply the Generated Token when asked for your password
The token will by copy-able at the top once you hit `Create personal access token` at the bottom

Once you have prepared everything it's time

### Step 7: See the results of your hard work in Gitlab
