Docker Basics and Good Practices \u00b6 The information below covers some recommended good practices with Docker and provides some links for further reading. Useful References and Background Reading: Python on Docker Handbook Container Security Fundamentals Book Start from a minimal official docker image \u00b6 Dockerhub has official images that are maintained by the Docker community (e.g. security updates happen in a timely manner). An official base image is usually a great starting point to build off of. Many custom images only slightly extend a common base image (e.g. Nvidia's base images are slight extensions of the ubuntu official base image) Recommendation: start from a small official base image and build layers ontop of it. Example steps to add a new image to aaw-contrib-containers 1. Scan image using a tool like Trivy $ ./trivy image hub.docker.com/yourdockerimage:latest (*best practice*) 2. Create new branch of StatCan/aaw-contrib-contains 3. Commit docker file and publish new branch 4. Allow repo CI, ACR and Artifactory scan to complete 5. Create pull request (ping us in our Slack space https://statcan-aaw.slack.com #general ) Scan your containers for vulnerabilities \u00b6 There are lots of tools to do this in an automated way (e.g. trivy ) Can build a docker image and scan it as part of a continuous integration pipeline. E.g. a condition to merge to master is that the Dockerfile provided must build successfully and then pass a security scan. Recommendation: scan images for vulnerabilities, and consider incorporating this process as a job in your CI/CD pipeline. Order stanzas from least likely to change to most likely to change \u00b6 Each line in your Dockerfile is called a stanza. When you are building an image, Docker is creating and caching an image layer for each stanza in your Dockerfile . Since layers are cached, if you build your image multiple times (e.g. you are changing certain stanzas), Docker can reuse the cached layers to reduce build time. However, any stanzas that come after the changed stanza will be rebuilt and therefore do not benefit from this layer caching that Docker implements. Recommendation: to take advantage of layer caching and reduce your image build times, it is recommended to put expensive stanzas that don't change often early in your Dockerfile, and put lighter stanzas that do change often at the end. This allows you to avoid rebuilding expensive unchanging layers every time you need to rebuild your image after making a small change (e.g. installing a new Python package). Handling python packages in Dockerfiles \u00b6 In general it is good practice to use a requirements.txt file in a project and to pin the versions ( pandas==1.2.3 rather than just pandas ). Requirements files are also useful in constructing more succinct Dockerfiles ( RUN pip install -r requirements.txt is briefer than RUN pip install package1 package2 ... ) But, sometimes requirements.txt files can cause issues in Dockerfiles. For example, if you have 10 packages that never change but one that is updated frequently, you have the same problem as when you put frequently changed items at the top of a Dockerfile. Sometimes it is appropriate to have requirements_rarely_changing.txt and requirements_frequently_changing.txt (or, perhaps better titles), this way the frequently changing packages can be installed later in the Dockerfile. Do setup, execute, and cleanup in a single stanza \u00b6 As mentioned above, docker creates image layers based on a single stanza. If you do these steps in 3 separate stanzas, you will create 3 different layers that will all be stacked on your image. This can lead to Docker images that take up a lot more space on disk than they need to. Good Example: RUN apt-get -y update && \\ apt-get install git && \\ rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* Bad Example: RUN apt-get -y update RUN apt-get install git RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* Recommendation: Keep your setup, execute, and cleanup work in a single stanza so that an image layer of minimal size gets created instead of multiple larger layers. Execute containers as non- root user \u00b6 If the base image doesn't have one, add a non-root user to your container . Don't forget to set USER at the end . By default, many containers are configured to run as root user. This is necessary at build time because we often need to install packages and change configuration settings. When it's time to run the container, however, we should run it as a non-root user (i.e. a less privileged user) by default. Reason for the above is that containers only provide process level virtualization as opposed to true operating system level virtualization. With a virtual machine manager such as VMWare, running as root on the VM doesn't give you access to the host machine. In a container runtime like Docker, however, your container is just a special kind of process on the host machine (spawned from the Docker Daemon on the host). This means it is possible for a malicious container to run as a process with root privileges on the host machine if the container itself is executed as root. Docker provides the USER directive to change the active user (can create a user using the adduser command in linux, see code snippet above). Recommendation: always set the user to a non-root user at the end of your Dockerfile by default using the USER directive in your Dockerfile. Do a multi-stage build \u00b6 There are a couple of key reasons to building an image in this way. Reduced disk footprint - you can use one image to build one or more artifacts, then simply copy the relevant build artifact(s) out of the first image into a second image. Improved Security - You can use a complete image to build your application, then copy your application into a distroless image. A distroless image is a very stripped down image that contains only your applications and its runtime dependencies (e.g. a Python image might contain a python interpreter in a virtual environment) This implies that there are no shells, package managers, or other programs you would expect to find on a standard Linux distribution). Improves security because there is much less attack surface area (i.e. there are fewer ways an attacker can perform a malicious act on a distroless image). Recommendation: consider using a multistage build to reduce disk footprint, and, if applicable, consider copying your applications/build artifacts to a distroless image to improve security. Avoid cache-busting your Dockerfiles \u00b6 Docker tries to avoid building anything it knows has not changed, but it cannot always detect this properly. When in situations where Docker always rebuilds layers unnecessarily, consider breaking your build into multiple images. This way you can put your static content in the first image, then base your final image on that first image ( FROM myfirstimage:v123 ). This way you prevent Docker from trying to decide if your static content needs to be rebuilt (but note, if you do this and your static content does need rebuidling, you need to do that yourself!) Sometimes with python packages Docker will misunderstand whether a requirements.txt has changed, forcing a full reinstall of your python packages even when they are cached. One way around this is to add RUN pip install mySlowPackages==0.1.2 explicitly near the top of the Dockerfile in addition to in your requirements.txt file later in the build . The benefit of this is that those explicit calls to pip are easier for Docker to cache, so they won't be reinstalled as frequently. And even though you do pip install -r requirements.txt later, pip itself will see that your package is already installed and skip it, meaning you save almost as much time as if Docker got the cache correct. Set build-time variables \u00b6 Docker provides an ARG directive that lets you specify build-time arguments. These build-time arguments don't persist when you launch a container instance from the image (in contrast to the ENV directive that sets environment variables that persist once the image is built). If you declare a build argument with ARG , you can pass --build-arg ARG_NAME=some_value when you run your docker build command to override whatever the default value of that argument is. Example: your image build depends on specific versions of another package you want to install, to make the image reusable, you may want to pass the package version as a build argument so that you can build different versions of the image over time. Example: you might want to set different build-time variables if you are building your image for different hosts (e.g. the URL for a proxy server). See documentation on Docker builds for more information. Recommendation: where applicable, consider using build-time arguments by using ARG and --build-arg to declare and override build-time arguments. Lint your Dockerfile \u00b6 There is a tool called hadolint that you can use to lint your Dockerfile. The linter will indicate areas where you can improve your Dockerfile and also provide suggestions. Recommendation: lint your Dockerfile to improve code quality. Understand when not to use Alpine-based images \u00b6 A popular minimal image that is used as a base image in the Docker community is the alpine image, which is based off of the Alpine distribution of Linux. This is a very lightweight image that has many use cases, but it may not be a good choice as a base image for data science oriented projects. In particular, for projects with heavy Python dependencies, it may be worth considering an alternative base image. Why? Reason is that most python packages include prebuilt wheels (wheels are a kind of pre-built distribution for python that allow you to avoid the build stage that is normally required with source distributions). Since Alpine is very stripped down compared to other Linux distributions, it has a different version of the standard C library that is required by most C programs (including Python). Specifically, the Alpine image uses the musl implementation of the C standard library instead of glibc implementation. Because of the above, Python wheels generally aren't available for musl , so when you install Python packages on an Alpine based image, you install the source code, which means that all C code in every Python package you use must be compiled. This also means you need to figure out every system library dependency yourself. Bottom Line: If you try to install a bunch of Python packages on an Alpine based image, your build may take longer, be more error prone, and result in a higher disk footprint than if you installed those Python packages on an image based on Debian or another Linux distribution with the full standard C library ( glibc ). Recommendation: Depending on your project requirements, if your project contains many Python dependencies, you may want to consider using a Docker image based on Debian or another Linux distribution other than Alpine. Note that this is not an absolute recommendation, as there are other considerations (e.g. security) that can impact the decision of which base image to use. However, you should be aware of the above-mentioned implication of using Alpine images for projects with significant Python dependencies.

An official base image is usually a great starting point to build off of. Many custom images only slightly extend a common base image (e.g. Nvidia's base images are slight extensions of the ubuntu official base image) Recommendation: start from a small official base image and build layers ontop of it. Example steps to add a new image to aaw-contrib-containers 1. Scan image using a tool like Trivy $ ./trivy image hub.docker.com/yourdockerimage:latest (*best practice*) 2.

When you are building an image, Docker is creating and caching an image layer for each stanza in your Dockerfile . Since layers are cached, if you build your image multiple times (e.g. you are changing certain stanzas), Docker can reuse the cached layers to reduce build time. However, any stanzas that come after the changed stanza will be rebuilt and therefore do not benefit from this layer caching that Docker implements. Recommendation: to take advantage of layer caching and reduce your image build times, it is recommended to put expensive stanzas that don't change often early in your Dockerfile, and put lighter stanzas that do change often at the end. This allows you to avoid rebuilding expensive unchanging layers every time you need to rebuild your image after making a small change (e.g. installing a new Python package).","title":"Order stanzas from least likely to change to most likely to change"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#handling-python-packages-in-dockerfiles","text":"In general it is good practice to use a requirements.txt file in a project and to pin the versions ( pandas==1.2.3 rather than just pandas ). Requirements files are also useful in constructing more succinct Dockerfiles ( RUN pip install -r requirements.txt is briefer than RUN pip install package1 package2 ... ) But, sometimes requirements.txt files can cause issues in Dockerfiles. For example, if you have 10 packages that never change but one that is updated frequently, you have the same problem as when you put frequently changed items at the top of a Dockerfile. Sometimes it is appropriate to have requirements_rarely_changing.txt and requirements_frequently_changing.txt (or, perhaps better titles), this way the frequently changing packages can be installed later in the Dockerfile.","title":"Handling python packages in Dockerfiles"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#do-setup-execute-and-cleanup-in-a-single-stanza","text":"As mentioned above, docker creates image layers based on a single stanza.

Good Example: RUN apt-get -y update && \\ apt-get install git && \\ rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* Bad Example: RUN apt-get -y update RUN apt-get install git RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* Recommendation: Keep your setup, execute, and cleanup work in a single stanza so that an image layer of minimal size gets created instead of multiple larger layers.","title":"Do setup, execute, and cleanup in a single stanza"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#execute-containers-as-non-root-user","text":"If the base image doesn't have one, add a non-root user to your container . Don't forget to set USER at the end . By default, many containers are configured to run as root user. This is necessary at build time because we often need to install packages and change configuration settings. When it's time to run the container, however, we should run it as a non-root user (i.e. a less privileged user) by default. Reason for the above is that containers only provide process level virtualization as opposed to true operating system level virtualization. With a virtual machine manager such as VMWare, running as root on the VM doesn't give you access to the host machine. In a container runtime like Docker, however, your container is just a special kind of process on the host machine (spawned from the Docker Daemon on the host). This means it is possible for a malicious container to run as a process with root privileges on the host machine if the container itself is executed as root. Docker provides the USER directive to change the active user (can create a user using the adduser command in linux, see code snippet above). Recommendation: always set the user to a non-root user at the end of your Dockerfile by default using the USER directive in your Dockerfile.","title":"Execute containers as non-root user"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#do-a-multi-stage-build","text":"There are a couple of key reasons to building an image in this way. Reduced disk footprint - you can use one image to build one or more artifacts, then simply copy the relevant build artifact(s) out of the first image into a second image. Improved Security - You can use a complete image to build your application, then copy your application into a distroless image. A distroless image is a very stripped down image that contains only your applications and its runtime dependencies (e.g. a Python image might contain a python interpreter in a virtual environment) This implies that there are no shells, package managers, or other programs you would expect to find on a standard Linux distribution). Improves security because there is much less attack surface area (i.e. there are fewer ways an attacker can perform a malicious act on a distroless image). Recommendation: consider using a multistage build to reduce disk footprint, and, if applicable, consider copying your applications/build artifacts to a distroless image to improve security.","title":"Do a multi-stage build"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#avoid-cache-busting-your-dockerfiles","text":"Docker tries to avoid building anything it knows has not changed, but it cannot always detect this properly. When in situations where Docker always rebuilds layers unnecessarily, consider breaking your build into multiple images. This way you can put your static content in the first image, then base your final image on that first image ( FROM myfirstimage:v123 ). This way you prevent Docker from trying to decide if your static content needs to be rebuilt (but note, if you do this and your static content does need rebuidling, you need to do that yourself!) Sometimes with python packages Docker will misunderstand whether a requirements.txt has changed, forcing a full reinstall of your python packages even when they are cached. One way around this is to add RUN pip install mySlowPackages==0.1.2 explicitly near the top of the Dockerfile in addition to in your requirements.txt file later in the build . The benefit of this is that those explicit calls to pip are easier for Docker to cache, so they won't be reinstalled as frequently. And even though you do pip install -r requirements.txt later, pip itself will see that your package is already installed and skip it, meaning you save almost as much time as if Docker got the cache correct.","title":"Avoid cache-busting your Dockerfiles"},{"location":"Aaw%20Contrib%20Containers/#set-build-time-variables","text":"Docker provides an ARG directive that lets you specify build-time arguments.

Example: your image build depends on specific versions of another package you want to install, to make the image reusable, you may want to pass the package version as a build argument so that you can build different versions of the image over time. Example: you might want to set different build-time variables if you are building your image for different hosts (e.g. the URL for a proxy server).

In particular, for projects with heavy Python dependencies, it may be worth considering an alternative base image. Why? Reason is that most python packages include prebuilt wheels (wheels are a kind of pre-built distribution for python that allow you to avoid the build stage that is normally required with source distributions).

Introduction \u00b6 Our Container images are based on the community driven jupyter/docker-stacks . We chose those images because they are continuously updated and install the most common utilities. This enables us to focus only on the additional toolsets that we require to enable our data scientists. These customized images are maintained by the AAW team and are the default images available on the kubeflow UI. This is different from the aaw-contrib-containers as those images are built by AAW user-base. These are often created when a user's workload is more specific and our generic images are not suitable for them. Those images can be used via the custom-image feature in kubeflow and do not populate the default images drop-down. Additionally, the AAW team is not responsible for maintaining those images. List of maintained images in this github repository \u00b6 Image Name Notes Extra Installations jupyterlab-cpu The base experience. A jupyterlab notebook with various installations. VsCode, R, Julia jupyterlab-pytorch For users looking to leverage a GPU machine. Comes installed with pytorch pytorch, torchvision jupyterlab-tensorflow For users looking to leverage a GPU machine. Comes installed with tensorflow tensorflow-gpu remote-desktop For users looking to have a desktop-like experience. Open M++, QGIS rstudio For users looking to have a rstudio tuned experience. sas Similar to our jupyterlab-cpu image, except with SAS. This is only available to Statistics Canada employees as that is what our license allows. Usage \u00b6 Generating Dockerfiles \u00b6 Use make generate-dockerfiles to generate all Dockerfile s. These will be written to ./output/imagename , along with any required files for the build context Building and Tagging Docker Images \u00b6 Use make build/IMAGENAME to build an already generated (see above) Dockerfile . This by default generates images with: * repo=k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io * tag=BRANCH_NAME For example: k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME . make build also accepts arguments for REPO and TAG to override these behaviours. For example, make build/jupyterlab-cpu REPO=myrepo TAG=notLatest . make post-build/IMAGENAME is meant for anything that is commonly done after building an image, but currently only adds common tags. It adds tags of SHA, SHORT_SHA, and BRANCH_NAME to the given image, and accepts a SOURCE_FULL_IMAGE_NAME argument if you're trying to tag an existing image that has a non-typical name. For example: * make post-build/IMAGENAME will apply SHA, SHORT_SHA, and BRANCH_NAME tags to k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME (eg: using the default REPO and TAG names) * make post-build/IMAGENAME SOURCE_FULL_IMAGE_NAME=oldRepo/oldImage:oldTag REPO=newRepo will make the following new aliases for oldRepo/oldImage:oldTag REPO=newRepo : * newRepo/IMAGENAME:SHA * newRepo/IMAGENAME:SHORT_SHA * newRepo/IMAGENAME:BRANCH_NAME Pulling and Pushing Docker Images \u00b6 make pull/IMAGENAME and make push/IMAGENAME work similarly to make build/IMAGENAME . REPO and TAG arguments are available to override their default values. Note: To use make pull or make push , you must first log in to ACR ( az acr login -n k8scc01covidacr ) Note: make push by default does docker push --all-tags in order to push the SHA, SHORT_SHA, etc., tags. Testing images \u00b6 Running and Connecting to Images Locally/Interactively \u00b6 To test an image interactively, use make dev/IMAGENAME . This docker run 's a built image, automatically forwarding ports to your local machine and providing a link to connect to. Automated Testing \u00b6 Automated tests are included for the generated Docker images using pytest . This testing suite is modified from the docker-stacks test suite. Image testing is invoked through make test/IMAGENAME (with optional REPO and TAG arguments like make build ). Testing of a given image consists of general and image-specific tests: \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests \u251c\u2500\u2500 general # General tests applied to all images \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_general_test.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 jupyterlab-cpu # Test applied to a specific image \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_jupyterlab-cpu-specific_test.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 jupyterlab-tensorflow Where tests/general tests are applied to all images, and tests/IMAGENAME are applied only to a specific image. Pytest will start the image locally and then run the provided tests to determine if Jupyterlab is running, python packages are working properly, etc. Tests are formatted using typical pytest formats (python files with def test_SOMETHING() functions). conftest.py defines some standard scaffolding for image management, etc. General Development Workflow \u00b6 \ud83d\udcbb Running AAW Locally (simple instructions) \u00b6 Clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/StatCan/aaw-kubeflow-containers . Build your image using make build/IMAGENAME , e.g. run make build/jupyterlab-tensorflow . Run make install-python-dev-venv to build a development Python virtual environment. Test your image using automated tests through make test/IMAGENAME , e.g. run make test/jupyterlab-tensorflow . Find your images (required for the next step) with docker images . You should see a table printed in the console with your images. For example you may see: username @hostname : ~ $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE k8scc01covidacr . azurecr . io / jupyterlab - tensorflow master 13 f8dc0e4f7a 26 minutes ago 14.6 GB k8scc01covidacr . azurecr . io / jupyterlab - pytorch master 2 b9acb795079 19 hours ago 15.5 GB jupyter / datascience - notebook 9 ed3b8de5de1 9 a0c8d86de1a 5 weeks ago 4.25 GB Run your image with docker run -p 8888:8888 REPO/IMAGENAME:TAG , e.g. docker run -p 8888:8888 k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/jupyterlab-tensorflow:master . Open http://localhost:8888 or <ip-address-of-server>:8888 .

Build, test, and scan CI triggers on: * any push to master * any push to an open PR This allows for easy scanning and automated testing for images. GitHub Actions CI also enables pushing built images to our ACRs, making them accessible from the platform. Pushes to the master branch will push to the k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io ACR and these are accessible from both the dev and prod cluster. You can access these images using any of the following: * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHA * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHORT_SHA * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:latest * k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:v1 Any push to an open PR that also has the auto-deploy label on the PR This allows developers to opt-in to on-platform testing. For example, when you need to build in github and test on platform (or want someone else to be able to pull your image): * open a PR and add the auto-deploy label * push to your PR and watch the GitHub Action CI * access your image in Kubeflow DEV via a custom image from any of: * k8scc01covidacrdev.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHA * k8scc01covidacrdev.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:SHORT_SHA * k8scc01covidacrdev.azurecr.io/IMAGENAME:dev (for convenience in testing) Images pushed to the dev acr are only available to the DEV cluster, attempting to use them in prod will fail. docker-bits, the Makefile and You \u00b6 The files in the docker-bits directory each make up a part of the final dockerfile and are combined depending on what type of dockerfile is being generated. You can see which \"docker-bits\" go into the dockerfile under their respective 'target'. For example for the remote-desktop image you can see in the makefile the following mkdir -p $( OUT ) / $@ echo \"REMOTE DESKTOP\" cp -r scripts/remote-desktop $( OUT ) / $@ cp -r resources/common/. $( OUT ) / $@ cp -r resources/remote-desktop/. $( OUT ) / $@ ## HERE IS WHAT GOES INTO THE DOCKERFILE $( CAT ) \\ $( SRC ) /0_Rocker.Dockerfile \\ $( SRC ) /3_Kubeflow.Dockerfile \\ $( SRC ) /4_CLI.Dockerfile \\ $( SRC ) /6_remote-desktop.Dockerfile \\ $( SRC ) /7_remove_vulnerabilities.Dockerfile \\ $( SRC ) /\u221e_CMD_remote-desktop.Dockerfile \\ > $( OUT ) / $@ /Dockerfile The first portion sets up and copies locally what scripts or utilities the final Dockerfile will need. The final Dockerfile is then generated using 0_Rocker.Dockerfile up to \u221e_CMD_remote-desktop.Dockerfile as you can see above. The Makefile sits in the root level of this directory and orchestrates the final dockerfile using the make generate-dockerfiles command. The segments of Dockerfile s are assembled and you can view which docker-bit it came from from the Dockerfile comments. All output images should meet the following criteria: be generated by calling make generate-dockerfiles have outputs written to output/imagename , where imagename is a valid Docker image name (eg: all lowercase, no special characters) Always, before pushing to a branch ensure you run make generate-dockerfiles as if the output dockerfiles are out of sync from the make generate-dockerfiles the CI will fail. Adding new software \u00b6 The developer has to make changes to the relevant docker-bit and then run the make generate-dockerfiles . NOTE: We do not allow for adding of software willy nilly, as our image sizes are already quite big (8Gb plus) and increasing that size would negatively impact the time it takes up for a workspace server to come up (as well as first time image pulls to a node). In such cases it may be more relevant to make an image under aaw-contrib-containers as mentioned earlier. Adding new Images \u00b6 To add new images, edit the makefile such that it generates the ./output/imagename directory. You can usually follow the existing recipes (or even add an extra piece to them), or you can add a whole new make target (but make sure to add your new target to make generate-dockerfiles as well). Modifying and Testing CI \u00b6 If making changes to CI that cannot be done on a branch (eg: changes to issue_comment triggers), you can: * fork the 'kubeflow-containers' repo * Modify the CI with * REGISTRY: (your own dockerhub repo, eg: \"j-smith\" (no need for the full url)) * Change - uses: azure/docker-login@v1 with: login-server: ${{ env.REGISTRY_NAME }}.azurecr.io username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} to - uses: docker/login-action@v1 with: username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} * In your forked repo, define secrets for REGISTRY_USERNAME and REGISTRY_PASSWORD with your dockerhub credentials (you should use an API token, not your actual dockerhub password) Note: Since pushing comes right at the end of the CI, in many cases you don't need to have a valid registry to test the CI on a fork. It will fail on the push step, but all other steps will clearly work and you can know it should safely merge back into the main repo. Other Development Notes \u00b6 The latest and v1 tags for the master branch \u00b6 These are intended to be long-lived in that they will not change. Subsequent pushes will clobber the previous jupyterlab-cpu:latest image. Previously when we built and pushed to master with updates to an image, we would need to go and change the spawner to use that new image. This will allow us to have them reference jupyterlab-cpu:latest and remove us from needing to update it. Additionally, upon changing the ImagePullPolicy to Always we could do restarts of workloads and then guarantee that users are on the 'latest' image. The v1 tag is intended for when we encounter a breaking change but still want to support the features of that current image. We would then branch off and modify the CI as well as increment the tag. Set User File Permissions after Every pip / conda Install or Edit of User's Home Files \u00b6 The Dockerfiles in this repo are intended to construct compute environments for a non-root user jovyan to ensure the end user has the least privileges required for their task, but installation of some of the software needed by the user must be done as the root user. This means that installation of anything that should be user editable (eg: pip and conda installs, additional files in /home/$NB_USER , etc.) will by default be owned by root and not modifiable by jovyan . Therefore we must change the permissions of these files to allow the user specific access for modification. For example, most pip install/conda install commands occur as the root user and result in new files in the $CONDA_DIR directory that will be owned by root and cause issues if user jovyan tried to update or uninstall these packages (as they by default will not have permission to change/remove these files). To fix this issue, end any RUN command that edits any user-editable files with: fix-permissions $CONDA_DIR && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER This fix edits the permissions of files in these locations to allow user access. Note that if these are not applied in the same layer as when the new files were added it will result in a duplication of data in the layer because the act of changing permissions on a file from a previous layer requires a copy of that file into the current layer. So something like: RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add a single layer of about 1GB, whereas RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh RUN fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add two layers, each about 1GB (2GB total).

To fix this issue, end any RUN command that edits any user-editable files with: fix-permissions $CONDA_DIR && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER This fix edits the permissions of files in these locations to allow user access. Note that if these are not applied in the same layer as when the new files were added it will result in a duplication of data in the layer because the act of changing permissions on a file from a previous layer requires a copy of that file into the current layer. So something like: RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh && \\ fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add a single layer of about 1GB, whereas RUN add_1GB_file_with_wrong_permissions_to_NB_USER.sh RUN fix-permissions /home/$NB_USER would add two layers, each about 1GB (2GB total).","title":"Set User File Permissions after Every pip/conda Install or Edit of User's Home Files"},{"location":"Aaw%20Kubeflow%20Containers/#structure","text":". \u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile # Cats the docker - bits together \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker - bits # The docker snippets .

This particular example demonstrates how to perform basic operations such as: How to register a new custom resource (custom resource type) of type Profile using a CustomResourceDefinition. How to create/get/list instances of your new resource type Profile . How to setup a controller on resource handling create/update/delete events. It makes use of the generators in k8s.io/code-generator to generate a typed client, informers, listers and deep-copy functions. You can do this yourself using the ./hack/update-codegen.sh script.

Overview \u00b6 The diagram below illustrates how profiles controller components are rolled out on the cluster.[^1][^2] ^3 [^1]: Gitlab icons provided by Gitlab Press Kit .

[^5]: Terraform icon provided by hashicorp [^6]: Kubeflow icon provided by kubeflow [^7]: Istio icons provided by Istio Media Resources How to Create a Controller \u00b6 Note : Modifying a controller is a subset of these steps; if you are only updating an existing controller, ignore the steps that don't apply. Create a .go file in the cmd folder of this repository with the name of your controller. Your controller must create a cobra.Command and register it with the rootCmd of the application. Your controller will be invoked with the entrypoint ./profiles-controller <your controller name> . Modify the profiles-controller helm chart in the StatCan charts repo. Add the deployment containing your new controller and update the values.yaml file accordingly with any new parameters specific to your container. Don't forget to increment the helm chart version if you made changes to the helm chart . Once your new controller is ready, merge your branch to the main branch of this repository. A Github action in this repository runs a build job (see .github/workflows/build.yml ) that builds the profiles-controller container image and pushes it to Azure container registry. The pushed image is tagged with the commit SHA of the git commit that triggered the Github Action. Go to the build job in the Github action and copy the commit SHA that the image is tagged with to your clipboard. This can be found at the top of the step called Run docker build in the build job. Go to the aaw-argocd-manifests repository and open the application.jsonnet file that deploys the profiles-controller ArgoCD application in the daaas-system namespace. In this file, paste the commit SHA from the previous step to the image.tag field. This updates the image tag for the base image used by the profiles-controller deployment. Note that you can make this edit directly through Github's editing features. This edit should be merged into either the aaw-dev-cc-00 branch or the aaw-prod-cc-00 branch depending on whether the update applies to the dev or prod environments. The profiles-controller ArgoCD application watches for changes to the application.jsonnet file on these branches. Controllers that Deploy Per-Namespace Applications \u00b6 Some controllers deploy per-namespace applications for each user (e.g. Gitea, S3Proxy). In this case, a few additional steps may be required. The profiles-argocd-system folder of the aaw-argocd-manifests repository contains manifests that get deployed by per-namespace ArgoCD applications. The intended pattern is that Kubernetes manifests are applied directly with Kustomize patches as required. Depending on what a particular per-namespace application looks like, there may be a manual step required where a developer must build the manifests by, for example, templating a helm chart and saving the output in a manifest.yaml file. In this case, a PR must be made to either the aaw-dev-cc-00 or aaw-prod-cc-00 branches of the aaw-argocd-manifests repo with the newly build manifest.yaml file. Terminology \u00b6 Helpful links to k8s resources, technologies and other terminologies related to this project are provided below. Profile Istio AuthorizationPolicy LimitRange ResourceQuotas Kubeflow Notebook Roles and RoleBinding (RBAC) Labels Blob CSI Driver Open Policy Agent (OPA) Details \u00b6 The profiles controller uses client-go library extensively. The details of interaction points of the profiles controller with various mechanisms from this library are explained here . Controllers \u00b6 The cmd package contains source files for a variety of profile controllers for Kubeflow. For more information about profile controllers, see the documentation for the client-go library, which contains a variety of mechanisms for use when developing custom profile controllers. The mechanisms are defined in the tools/cache folder of the library. authpolicy.go \u00b6 Responsible for creating, removing and updating Istio Authorization Policies using the Istio client for a given Profile . Currently, the only AuthorizationPolicy is to block upload/download from protected-b Notebook 's. blob-csi.go \u00b6 Creates an Azure Blob Storage container for a user in a few storage accounts (e.g. standard , protected-b , etc.) and binds a PersistentVolume to the container using the blob-csi driver . This relies on secrets stored in a system namespace --- secrets are not accessible by users. The controller also creates a PVC in the users namespace bound to this specific PV. Supports read-write and read-only PersistentVolumes using mountOptions. PVCs are ReadWriteMany or ReadOnlyMany, respectively Supports both protected-b and unclassified mounts. In addition, the controller is responsible for managing links from PersistentVolume 's to any buckets from Fair Data Infrastructure (FDI) Section of DAaas. This is accomplished by querying unclassified and protected-b OPA gateways which return json responses containing buckets along with permissions. The controller parses the returned json , creating a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for each bucket in accordance with the permission constraints. Configuration \u00b6 BLOB_CSI_FDI_OPA_DAEMON_TICKER_MILLIS : the time interval at which the opa gateways are queried, in milliseconds. BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_OPA_ENDPOINT : the http address pointing to the unclassified OPA gateway. BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_SPN_SECRET_NAME : the name of a secret containing data azurestoragespnclientsecret: value , where value is a secret registered under the unclassified FDI service principal. BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_SPN_SECRET_NAMESPACE : the namespace the above secret is contained in. BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_PV_STORAGE_CAP : the storage capacity for FDI PV's in Terabytes. BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_TYPE : for the current implementation, only spn auth type is supported BLOB_CSI_FDI_UNCLASS_AZURE_STORAGE_AAD_ENDPOINT : the azure active directory endpoint BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_OPA_ENDPOINT : the http address pointing to the protected-b OPA gateway. BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_SPN_SECRET_NAME : the name of a secret containing data azurestoragespnclientsecret: value , where value is a secret registered under the protected-b FDI service principal. BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_SPN_SECRET_NAMESPACE : the namespace the above secret is contained in. BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_PV_STORAGE_CAP : the storage capacity for FDI PV's in Terabytes. BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_TYPE : for the current implementation, only spn auth type is supported BLOB_CSI_FDI_PROTECTED_B_AZURE_STORAGE_AAD_ENDPOINT : the azure active directory endpoint For more context on the blob-csi system as a whole, see here This will deprecate the minio controller. Local Development \u00b6 The Taskfile includes task blobcsi:dev for preparing your local environment for development and testing. Due to the controller's dependency on Azure blob-csi driver a cluster with the blob-csi driver installed is required. As such, it is recommended to debug and test against the development k8s context for AAW. With the local environment configured, the Vscode Debugger can be used through Run and Debug: blobcsi Controller in the debug pane. gitea.go \u00b6 Responsible for deploying gitea as argocd applications per Profile . Currently, argocd applications are deployed by the gitea controller based on the customized gitea manifest found here . The diagram below highlights the key components involved with the Gitea controller Gitea User Interface \u00b6 The unclassified Gitea user interface is embedded within the Kubeflow dashboard 's user interface, rendered by an iframe. Protected-b gitea is setup to be accessible only through a protected-b node, and thus the user is expected to access their protected-b gitea instance within an AAW ubuntu VM, or through the CLI in a protected-b notebook. Requests to a namespace's Gitea server are made to the Kubeflow base url with the suffix /gitea-unclassified/?ns=<user-namespace> , where the user's namespace is passed as an http parameter. An Istio Virtual Service created by the gitea.go controller contains an http route that redirects traffic from /gitea-unclassified/?ns=<user-namespace> to /gitea-unclassified/<user-namespace>/ . A second http route routes traffic from /gitea-unclassified/<user-namespace>/ to the Gitea instance in the user's namespace. The Gitea application server sets the ROOT_URL environment variable to contain the Kubeflow base URL with the /gitea-unclassified/<user-namespace>/ . This is required as it is the application's responsibility to establish the URLS that will be used in the browser to retrieve static assets and send requests to application endpoints. The Gitea application values.yaml file makes use of pod fields as environment variables and dependent environment variables to create a ROOT_URL that depends on the user's namespace. Additionally, an upstream gitea issue indicates that it is possible to set multiple domains in the ROOT_URL environment variable by using the syntax ROOT_URL=https://(domain1,domain2)/gitea/ , which is how the dev/prod domains are set without needing to check the deployment environment. To allow requests to reach the user's Gitea instance, a Network Policy is set in the user's namespace that allows ingress traffic from the kubeflow-gateway to be sent to any pods in the user's namespace that match the app: gitea && app.kubernetes.io/instance: gitea-unclassified label selector. Configuration \u00b6 The Gitea controller is configurable to run in unclassified or protected-b mode. The configuration of the following parameters thus need set to run the controller: GITEA_CLASSIFICATION : the classification the controller should be running against. Currently, unclassified and protected-b are supported as values. GITEA_PSQL_PORT : port of the postgres instance the gitea application will connect to GITEA_PSQL_ADMIN_UNAME : username of a priviledged user within the postgres instance GITEA_PSQL_ADMIN_PASSWD : password for the above user GITEA_PSQL_MAINTENANCE_DB : maintenance DB name in the postgres instance GITEA_SERVICE_URL : internal Gitea URL is specified in here GITEA_URL_PREFIX : url prefix for redirecting gitea GITEA_SERVICE_PORT : the port exposed by gitea service, as specified here GITEA_BANNER_CONFIGMAP_NAME : gitea banner configmap name (configmap which corresponds to the banner at the top of the gitea ui) GITEA_ARGOCD_NAMESPACE : namespace for arcocd instance that the controller will install applications into GITEA_ARGOCD_SOURCE_REPO_URL : repository url containing the gitea deployment manifest GITEA_ARGOCD_SOURCE_TARGET_REVISION : git branch to deploy from GITEA_ARGOCD_SOURCE_PATH : path to the manifest from the root of the git source repo GITEA_ARGOCD_PROJECT : argocd instances's project to deploy applications within GITEA_SOURCE_CONTROL_ENABLED_LABEL : this label will be searched for within profiles to indicate if a user has opted in. GITEA_KUBEFLOW_ROOT_URL : the url for kubeflow's central dashboard (for dev: https://kubeflow.aaw-dev.cloud.statcan.ca, for production: https://kubeflow.aaw.cloud.statcan.ca) Within AAW, these variables are defined in the statcan charts repo , and they are configured within the dev argocd-manifests-repo or prod argocd-manifests-repo . limitrange.go \u00b6 Responsible for creating, removing and updating LimitRange resources for a given profile. LimitRange resources are generated to limit the cpu and memory resources for the kubeflow profile's default container. LimitRange resources require the implementation of a controller managing ResourceQuotas , which is provided in this package (see quotas.go ). Implementing LimitRange resources allows any Pod to run associated with the Profile , restricted by a ResourceQuota . minio.go \u00b6 Responsible for the configuration of MinIO buckets for the given Profile . Configured MinIO buckets may be used by the associated Profile for object storage accessible directly within their notebooks. network.go \u00b6 Responsible for the following networking policies: Ingress from the ingress gateway Ingress from knative-serving Egress to the cluster local gateway Egress from unclassified workloads Egress from unclassified workloads to the ingress gateway Egress to port 443 from protected-b workloads Egress to the daaas-system Egress to vault Egress to pipelines Egress to MinIO Egress to Elasticsearch Egress to Artifactory notebook.go \u00b6 Responsible for the configuration of Notebook resources within Kubeflow. This controller adds a default option for running a protected-b Notebook . quotas.go \u00b6 Responsible for the generation of ResourceQuotas for a given profile. Management of ResourceQuotas is essential, as it provides the constraint for total amount of compute resources that are consumable within the Profile . Since the ResourceQuotas definition included in quotas.go provides constraints for cpu and memory, the limits for the values must be defined. These limits are defined as LimitRange resources and are managed by limitrange.go . Quota Labels \u00b6 In order for ArgoCD to sync Profile resources, the /metadata/labels/ field needed to be ignored. However, this field is required in ResourceQuota resource generation. A Label is provided for each type of quota below, which allows ResourceQuotas to be overidden by the controller for each resource type: quotas.statcan.gc.ca/requests.cpu quotas.statcan.gc.ca/limits.cpu quotas.statcan.gc.ca/requests.memory quotas.statcan.gc.ca/limits.memory quotas.statcan.gc.ca/requests.storage quotas.statcan.gc.ca/pods quotas.statcan.gc.ca/services.nodeports quotas.statcan.gc.ca/services.loadbalancers A special case is considered for overriding gpu resources. Although the label quotas.statcan.gc.ca/gpu exists for the given Profile , the label requests.nvidia.com/gpu is overidden. rbac.go \u00b6 Responsible for the generation of Roles and RoleBinding resources for a given profile. A Role is created for each Profile , the following RoleBinding 's are created: ml-pipeline role binding for the Profile . DAaas-AAW-Support is granted a profile-support cluster role in the namespace for support purposes. root.go \u00b6 The root interface for the profile controllers. Deployment \u00b6 A helm chart for deploying the profile controllers can be found here . Each controller has a corresponding k8s manifest.

The purpose of this controller is to ensure that profiles/namespaces are correctly labelled so that other applications in the cluster can make allow/deny decisions based on these labels. The sections below detail specific labels and the logic they use. Employee Only Features \u00b6 This controller adds the state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/employee-only-features label to the Profiles based on the Pods in that namespace. If any Pods in that namespace are using a SAS image, it will set the label in the Profile to true , otherwise false . Unit Test Cases \u00b6 If any pod in a list of pods contains a SAS image, hasSasNotebookFeature should return true . If no pod in a list of pods contains a SAS image, hasSasNotebookFeature should return false . If an empty list is passed to hasSasNotebookFeature , it should return false . Non-Employee Users \u00b6 This controller also adds the state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users label to the Profiles based on the RoleBindings in that namespace. When the owner of a Kubeflow Profile adds a contributor to their namespace, a rolebinding is created in that namespace , binding the new contributor to the kubeflow-edit role in that namespace. Specifically, contributors are named by their email address (emails with a StatCan domain are considered employees and all other domains are considered non-employees). If at any point a contributor with an external email address is added to a Kubeflow Profile, the Profile State Controller sets the label state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users=true on both the Kubeflow Profile and the corresponding namespace. If the RoleBinding shows that the user is external (email does not end with an accepted domain), it will set the label in the Profile to true otherwise false . Other applications on the cluster can use this label to make decisions based on whether namespaces contain non-employee users. Unit Test Cases \u00b6 If any rolebinding in a list of rolebindings contains a non-employee user, existsNonSasUser should return true . If no rolebinding in a list of rolebindings contains a non-employee user, existsNonSasUser should return false . If an empty list is passed to existsNonSasUser , it should return false . The Gatekeeper Policies check for these labels in the Profile and allow objects to be created or denied accordingly. More information about these policies and how the objects interact can be found in their README in the Gatekeeper Policies repository (linked below). - Deny External Users Policy - state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/employee-only-features affects RoleBinding and AuthorizationPolicy objects - which allows or denies adding external contributors - Checks to see if there are any employee only features (like SAS images) in the namespace through a profile label. If there are, then it will only allow the RoleBinding and AuthorizationPolicy to be created for internal users. - Employee-Only Features Policy - state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users affects Pod and Notebook objects - which allows or denies creation of SAS Notebook Servers - Checks to see if there are any external users in a namespace through a Profile label. If there are, then it will not allow the SAS Pod and Notebook to be created. Implementation in Kubeflow \u00b6 Add an External Contributor with a SAS image on your namespace - Create a new notebook server with a custom SAS image - If you go to Manage Contributors and try to add an external user then it will give you an error so you will not be allowed to add them as a contributor to your namespace. *If you want to add the external contributor, you will have to delete the notebook server with the SAS image first and then add retry adding them a contributor.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \u00b6 If your question does not appear in this document, please reach out to us on our Slack Support Channel . Who an access the AAW? \u00b6 Anyone with a Statistics Canada ( @statcan.gc.ca ) email address can access the AAW. What data formats are supported in the AAW? \u00b6 The AAW includes tools that allow data science users to open almost any file. The AAW supports many commonly used file formats, including (but not limited to): csv xlsx json xml sas7bdat sqlite many others... just ask :-) How much does the AAW cost? \u00b6 StatCan is footing the bill for the time being. To give you a rough estimate of costs, please consult the following table. NB: these are just estimates. CPU Only \u00b6 Use Case Compute Resources Time (Hours/Week) Cost CPU RAM (GB) GPU Weekly Monthly Annually CPU: Occasional Use 2 8 0 8 1.1367 4.88781 59.1084 CPU: During Business Hours 2 8 0 40 5.6835 24.43905 295.542 CPU: 24/7 2 8 0 168 23.8707 102.64401 1241.2764 Add a GPU \u00b6 Use Case Compute Resources Time (Hours/Week) Cost CPU RAM (GB) GPU Weekly Monthly Annually GPU: Occaisonal Use 0 0 1 8 34.468 148.2124 1792.336 GPU: During Business Hours 0 0 1 40 172.34 741.062 8961.68 GPU: 24/7 0 0 1 168 723.828 3112.4604 37639.056 What are the steps for getting Protected B data into MinIO? \u00b6 One must consult with FDI (F.A.I.R. Data Infrastructure) before Protected B Data can be loaded into MinIO. The FDI team owns an Azure Data Factory pipeline for moving data, typically from on premise, to an Azure Storage Account and MinIO is our S3 gateway to that storage account. Can we use Power BI on the AAW? \u00b6 At the moment, no. We are currently looking into solutions for sharing data between the AAW and CAE (which supports Power BI). Does using SAS entail different costs than the others? Are there a limited number of licenses or instances that can be run? \u00b6 SAS support is currently experimental and will rely on existing Statistics Canada SAS software licenses. How do you suspend your server (to save costs)? \u00b6 Press the suspend server button (square to the left of the garbage can icon to delete a server). This will suspend the workspace to save on costs. Please keep in mind all data that is not stored on persistent disks (persistent workspace volume or persistent data volumes) is deleted when a workspace is suspended. In particular data on non-persistent disks and data on the filesystem outside the workspace or data volume (for instance the /tmp folder) will be permanently lost. When suspended the workspace and data volumes remain locked and cannot be deleted or attached to another server. To resume a suspended server, press the resume button (triangle icon to the left of the garbage can). When resumed the server will have the same workspace and data volumes as before (with all data kept as-is if the volumes were persistent) and has the exact same specification (CPU, RAM, GPU, and other settings). Things stored outside the home directory and persistent data volumes (like conda virtual environments) will be gone and will need to be recreated if necessary. How do I add other people to my namespace (for collaboration)? \u00b6 Do we need to stop any running instances in our notebooks when we\u2019re not using it? If so, how do we do this? I checked the documentation and there is no guidelines on how to stop any running notebooks as a cost-saving measure. Are there any pre-loaded data (datasets) in AAW that we can access and use for both R and Python notebooks? \u00b6 Our JupyterLab images come with some example notebooks and data, they can be found in /aaw-contrib-jupyter-notebooks/ . Our R Studio image also has some example notebooks and data, they can be found in /aaw-contrib-r-notebooks/ .

Navigate to http://10.10.10.10 . Follow on-screen steps to start Kubeflow and Rok (takes about another 20 minutes). From here, you can use Kubeflow and Rok. Then configure kubectl to connect to your new cluster: Download the miniKF kubectl config file from http://10.10.10.10 . Use the downloaded configuration for kubectl , either replacing, or merging it into, ~/.kube/config . Ensure kubectl config current-context is pointing to your local cluster. Your KF_USER_ID can be the default user that was created for your miniKF cluster (typically user ). Each time you need to start the cluster, navigate to the directory you created and run vagrant up . Note : after some experimentation, it was found that the vagrant file could be modified on line 57 to use 8gb instead of the default 12. config . vm . provider \"virtualbox\" do | vb | # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine # vb . gui = true # Customize the amount of memory on the VM : vb . memory = \"8192\" end Remote AKS Cluster \u00b6 Install Azure CLI az and kubectl Login with az and set your subscription Run az aks get-credentials for the desired remote cluster Ensure kubectl config current-context is pointing to the correct AKS cluster License \u00b6 Unless otherwise noted, the source code of this project is covered under Crown Copyright, Government of Canada, and is distributed under the MIT License .

Submitting a Dashboard \u00b6 To submit your own dashboard: Fork this R-dashboards repo. Add your dashboard to an unclaimed top level directory (similar to /covid-19-dashboard and others). Note that the name you choose here also sets your dashboard's URL ( https://shiny.covid.cloud.statcan.ca/my-well-named-dashboard ). You need to embed your dashboard's data directly in your Shiny project (for example, see /ev-data-viz/data ). A more flexible solution is in the works but not yet completed. \u26a0 If your data is large (more than a few MB) please discuss with us first. Do one of the following: (Optional but appreciated - this will speed up our review/release process.) Test your dashboard against the central shiny implementation by following the Deployment Testing Instructions section below. In particular, identify any packages that are missing from the shiny repo and note them in the text of your PR. Check this packages file to see if all R packages you use are included in the list. If any are missing, note them in the text of your PR. Open a PR to merge your fork into R-dashboards:master. Start your PR title with \"[WIP]\" to indicate your work in progress and remove it once you are ready to merge. See here and here for example PRs. Testing your Dashboard \u00b6 To test any new/updated dashboards prior to deployment, do the following: Submit a pull request to the R-dashboards repo with your new/updated dashboard. Clone the PR for review from the R-dashboards repo (replace <PR_NUMBER> with the PR number from GitHub). bash pr_number=<PR_NUMBER> git clone https://github.com/StatCan/R-dashboards.git cd R-dashboards git fetch origin pull/$pr_number/head:pr$pr_number git checkout pr$pr_number # Save this directory for later path_to_r_dashboards=`pwd` cd - Clone and build the shiny server locally.

If there are any bugs, fix them locally and iterate above until solved. Tip: If a package is missing, update the Shiny server Dockerfile to import packages from an additional PACKAGE_temp and put any new packages there while testing. This saves time by avoiding reinstalling previously installed packages.

Dependencies \u00b6 An Azure subscription An Azure account with sufficient privileges to deploy: Resource group Role assignment Networking \u00b6 Nodes in the cluster must be attached to an existing subnet within an Azure Virtual Network. The subnet must have a Network Virtual Appliance at the default route (ie. 0.0.0.0/0 ). See the Azure documentation on egress for more information.
